    Currently I'm working at <a href="https://fortris.com">Fortris</a>, a
    fintech company which his main product is a crypto asset managment system
    where I'm one of the Frontend guys!
  </p>
  <p>
    Technologies like Angular, Nx, NestJS, GraphQL, ... all of them are part of
    my daily bases. But I'm happy to say that I've worked with tons of Frontend
    technologies such as React, NextJS, Loopback, Ionic, Electron, ...
  </p>
  <p>
    Not just that, I'm a curious person and I'm always learning and improving.
    In fact, this web is made with Astro. Have you heard about Astro before?
