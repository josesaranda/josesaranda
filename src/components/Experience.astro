  During my short life as engineer I've been involved in many projects with
  different technologies. Here you can see my workaround:

      In this stage at Sombradoble we develop an hybrid mobile app called
      MyLeaf. This app was made using Ionic Framework. MyLeaf allowed patients
      with chronic and rare diseases to monitorice their day by day and analise
      the evolution they had along the time having a more knowledge about their
      medicaments ingest, activities they did and food they ate. All of these
      features was hosted in a server app developed with NodeJS getting data
      from a SQLServer database.
